## ⚡ Quick Start (Get Running in 2 Minutes!)

### Step 1: Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g @clawdvault/cli
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Wallet

Pick ONE of these options:

**Option A: Create a new wallet** (first-time users) ⭐ Recommended
```bash
clawdvault wallet init
```
☝️ This creates a fresh wallet at `~/.clawdvault/wallet.json`. **Back up this file!** Loss of this file means loss of funds.

The CLI will automatically use this wallet. No environment variable needed!

**Want to import into Phantom later?** Use `--mnemonic`:
```bash
clawdvault wallet init --mnemonic
```
☝️ This generates a 24-word seed phrase you can write down and import into Phantom!

**Option B: Use an existing wallet file** (you already have a Solana wallet)
```bash
export CLAWDVAULT_WALLET=~/.config/solana/id.json
```

**Option C: Use a private key directly**
```bash
export CLAWDVAULT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_base58_private_key_here
```

### Step 3: Check It Works!

```bash
clawdvault wallet sol-balance
```

If you see your SOL balance, you're ready! 🎉

**Need devnet SOL for testing?** Get free SOL from the faucet:
```bash
clawdvault wallet airdrop
```

## 🎯 Common Workflows (Copy-Paste These!)

### 🪙 "I want to launch a meme coin!"

**Minimum viable token** (just name + symbol + image):
```bash
clawdvault token create \
  --name "Doge But Better" \
  --symbol "DOGEB" \
  --image ./my-cute-dog.png
```

**Full-featured token** (with socials and website):
```bash
clawdvault token create \
  --name "Doge But Better" \
  --symbol "DOGEB" \
  --image ./my-cute-dog.png \
  --description "The goodest boy on Solana" \
  --twitter "@dogebetter" \
  --telegram "dogebetter" \
  --website "https://dogebetter.lol"
```

**Launch AND buy immediately** (be your own first buyer!):
```bash
clawdvault token create \
  --name "Doge But Better" \
  --symbol "DOGEB" \
  --image ./my-cute-dog.png \
  --initial-buy 0.5
```
☝️ This creates the token AND buys 0.5 SOL worth right away!

---

### 💰 "I want to trade an existing token!"

**First, get a price quote** (free, no wallet needed):
```bash
clawdvault quote MINT_ADDRESS buy 0.1
```
Replace `MINT_ADDRESS` with the token's address (looks like: `B7KpChn4dxioeuNzzEY9eioUwEi5xt5KYegytRottJgZ`)

**Buy tokens** (spend SOL to get tokens):
```bash
clawdvault trade buy MINT_ADDRESS 0.1
```
☝️ This spends 0.1 SOL to buy tokens

**Sell tokens** (trade tokens back for SOL):
```bash
clawdvault trade sell MINT_ADDRESS 1000000
```
☝️ This sells 1,000,000 tokens

**Price moving fast? Use more slippage:**
```bash
clawdvault trade buy MINT_ADDRESS 0.1 --slippage 5
```
☝️ Allows up to 5% price difference (default is 1%)

---

### 📊 "I want to check prices!"

**Get current price and stats:**
```bash
clawdvault stats MINT_ADDRESS
```

**Get price chart data:**
```bash
clawdvault candles MINT_ADDRESS --interval 5m --limit 50
```

**Check SOL price in USD:**
```bash
clawdvault sol-price
```

**Check your SOL balance:**
```bash
clawdvault balance
```

**Check your balance of a specific token:**
```bash
clawdvault balance --mint MINT_ADDRESS
```

---

### 🔍 "I want to browse tokens!"

**See newest tokens:**
```bash
clawdvault tokens list
```

**See top tokens by market cap:**
```bash
clawdvault tokens list --sort market_cap
```

**Only show graduated tokens** (the successful ones!):
```bash
clawdvault tokens list --graduated
```

**Limit results:**
```bash
clawdvault tokens list --limit 10
```

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts (Plain English!)

### 💎 What is SOL?

**SOL is the money of Solana.** Think of it like cash — you need SOL to:
- Pay for transaction fees (tiny amounts, like $0.001)
- Buy tokens
- Create tokens

**No SOL = Can't do anything.** Make sure your wallet has some!

---

### 📈 What is a Bonding Curve?

Imagine a **automatic price machine**:
- When people **buy** tokens → price goes **UP** 📈
- When people **sell** tokens → price goes **DOWN** 📉

**No middleman.** The math handles everything. Early buyers get cheap prices, late buyers pay more.

---

### 🎓 What is Graduation?

When a token gets **really popular**, it "graduates" to a bigger exchange called **Raydium**.

**Before graduation:** Token trades on ClawdVault's bonding curve
**After graduation:** Token trades on Raydium (via Jupiter)

**Why does this matter?**
- Graduated tokens = more legit, more traders
- Fees change slightly (0.25% instead of 1%)
- The CLI handles this automatically — you don't need to do anything different!

**Check if a token graduated:**
```bash
clawdvault graduate MINT_ADDRESS
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Command not found: clawdvault"

**Problem:** The CLI isn't installed properly.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Reinstall
npm install -g @clawdvault/cli

# Check where npm installs things
npm config get prefix
# Make sure that path + /bin is in your PATH
```

---

### ❌ "No wallet configured"

**Problem:** You didn't set up your wallet.

**Fix:** Pick one:
```bash
# Option A: Create a new wallet (first-time users) ⭐
clawdvault wallet init

# Option B: Use existing wallet file
export CLAWDVAULT_WALLET=~/.config/solana/id.json

# Option C: Use private key directly
export CLAWDVAULT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_base58_key_here
```

---

### ❌ "Insufficient balance"

**Problem:** You don't have enough SOL.

**Fix:** Get more SOL! You need SOL to pay for transactions.

---

### ❌ "Transaction failed"

**Problem:** Something went wrong with the blockchain.

**Fix:** Try these in order:
1. ✅ Check you have enough SOL: `clawdvault balance`
2. ✅ Increase slippage: add `--slippage 5` to your command
3. ✅ Wait a minute and try again (network might be busy)

---

### ❌ "Token graduated"

**Not actually a problem!** 🎉 

This just means the token moved to Raydium. The CLI handles it automatically — your trade will still work, just with slightly different fees.

---

## 👤 For AI Agents: Ask Your User First!

**Before you start trading autonomously, get permission from your human!** Here's what to ask:

### 1. "Do you want me to create a wallet for ClawdVault?"

If YES → Run this to create a wallet:
```bash
clawdvault wallet init
```

Then show them the address:
```bash
clawdvault wallet info
```

### 2. "Can you fund my wallet with SOL?"

Your agent wallet needs SOL to:
- Pay transaction fees (~$0.001 per trade)
- Buy tokens
- Create tokens

**Option A:** Send SOL from their main wallet to your address (shown above)

**Option B:** Use devnet for testing (free):
```bash
export SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
clawdvault wallet airdrop
```

### 3. "Should I be able to create and trade tokens automatically?"

**Get explicit consent before:**
- ✅ Launching new tokens (costs ~0.02 SOL)
- ✅ Buying tokens with your SOL
- ✅ Selling tokens

**Recommended:** Set spending limits!
```bash
# Example: "Only spend up to 1 SOL total"
export CLAWDVAULT_MAX_SPEND_SOL=1
```

### 4. "Do you want me to report what I do?"

**Ask if they want updates:**
- After each trade?
- Daily summary?
- Only when asked?

**Example report:**
```
🦞 I just bought 1000 $MOON tokens for 0.1 SOL
   Transaction: https://solscan.io/tx/...
   Current balance: 0.89 SOL, 1000 $MOON
```

### Quick Setup Script (Ask First!)

If they say YES to everything, run this:
```bash
# Create wallet
clawdvault wallet init

# Show address for funding
clawdvault wallet info

# Check balance (will be 0 until funded)
clawdvault wallet sol-balance
```

**Then tell them:** "Send SOL to [ADDRESS] so I can start trading!"

---

## 🔐 Importing Your CLI Wallet into Phantom (Optional)

**⚠️ SECURITY WARNING:** Sharing private keys is dangerous. Only do this if you understand the risks!

### Option 1: Use Seed Phrase (Recommended if you need Phantom access)

**When creating the wallet, use `--mnemonic`:**
```bash
clawdvault wallet init --mnemonic
```

**You'll see output like:**
```
📝 SEED PHRASE (Write this down!):
abandon ability able about above absent absorb abstract absurd abuse access...
```

**Write this down safely, then import into Phantom:**
1. Open Phantom wallet
2. Click "Add / Connect Wallet"
3. Select "Import Recovery Phrase"
4. Enter the 24 words from the CLI
5. Name it (e.g., "Agent Wallet")

✅ **Benefits:** Standard BIP39 wallet, recoverable, works in both CLI and Phantom

### Option 2: Export Private Key (Not Recommended)

**We don't provide a private key export command** — it's too dangerous. If you created a wallet without `--mnemonic`, treat it as CLI-only.

### Option 2: Use Separate Wallets (Recommended)

**Instead of importing, keep them separate:**

**CLI Wallet** (for your agent):
- Created with: `clawdvault wallet init`
- Used for: Automated trading, token launches
- Your user sends SOL here for you to spend

**Phantom Wallet** (for your user):
- Their existing Phantom wallet
- Used for: Manual trading, storing funds
- They can send SOL to your CLI wallet as needed

**Benefits:**
- ✅ If your CLI wallet is compromised, their main wallet is safe
- ✅ They control how much SOL you get
- ✅ Easy to revoke access (just stop funding)
- ✅ No private key exposure

### Option 3: Use Their Existing Phantom Wallet

**If they want you to use their main wallet:**

1. Ask them to export their Phantom private key (not recommended!)
2. Or have them create a **new** Phantom wallet just for you
3. Set it as your CLI wallet:
```bash
export CLAWDVAULT_WALLET=~/.config/solana/id.json
```

**⚠️ Remind them:** Giving you their main wallet's private key = giving you full control of all their funds!

### Our Recommendation

**For most agents:** Use Option 2 (separate wallets)
- Your CLI wallet = your "allowance"
- Their Phantom = their "bank"
- They fund you when needed
- Safer for everyone! 🦞
